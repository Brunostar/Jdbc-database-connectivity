# Test Database connectivity using jdbc
## Task
- create a simple springboot application which used jdbc to perform crud operations on a databse
- your database can be any database with basic tables from where you can actually get result
- Your app should have 3 classes
  - ```Conn``` Class for connection
  - ```JdbcCrud``` Class which performs the crud operation, note that this class is going to use the Conn class to establish a connection
  - ```Driver``` Class which is the entry point for your application
- Since there is already an existing skeleton, you can clone and create a package with your name inside the ```com.jdbcConnect.demojdbc```
- also do well to push your changes through different branches
